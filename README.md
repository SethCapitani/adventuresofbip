Adventures of Bip: Trials of the Mushroom

A turn-based adventure RPG created as a college collaboration. Players control Bip, a young adventurer in a forest who battles enemies like Dominus Tweedle the infected frog using skills like Sword Slash and Rock Throw, alongside items for HP recovery and strategy.

This project was a collaboration at college by a team which included me and 4 other students.
